The `known_host` file isn't related to your problem.  
It's seems to be the problem, that your agent knows too many keys.

You can try it with

```bash
ssh -o IdentityAgent=none -i private_key_file_for_raspberry ...
```

You can add this to your config file, too.

```bash
HOST raspi42
   hostname raspberry.myhome
   user pi
   IdentityAgent none
   IdentityFile private_key_file_for_raspberry
```
